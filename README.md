# Yore

Yore was a group project undertaken by [Jamie Sime](https://github.com/jamiesime), [Louise Reid](https://github.com/LouiseReid), [Alex MacFadyen](https://github.com/AMacFadyen) and [James Stewart](https://github.com/ShetlandJ) as part of CodeClan, Scotland's Digital Skills academy.

You can play [Yore at this link](https://yoregame.herokuapp.com/)! 

The class was divided up into groups and given a list of potential projects. Our group decided to combine two separate specs -> create an educational website and create a browser game.

The result of 6 days work is Yore - an in-browser historical game that puts the user in the position of a Scottish family who are evicted from their croft in the Highlands and join the thousands of Scots who emigrated to Canada.
